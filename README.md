## 🚀 Machine Learning Workflow

### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
import xgboost as xgb
```

### Step 2: Load Dataset
```python
# Load dataset from CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
```

### Step 3: Data Preparation
```python
X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])  # Features
y = data['target_column']  # Target variable
```

### Step 4: Train-Test Split
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Feature Scaling (If Needed)
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 6: Feature Selection
```python
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=5)
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train_scaled, y_train)
X_test_selected = selector.transform(X_test_scaled)
```

### Step 7: Model Training
```python
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(),
    'AdaBoost': AdaBoostClassifier(),
    'XGBoost': xgb.XGBClassifier()
}

for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train_selected, y_train)
```

### Step 8: Model Evaluation
```python
for name, model in models.items():
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test_selected)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'{name}: Accuracy = {accuracy:.4f}')
```

## 🔍 Feature Scaling
Feature scaling ensures all numerical values have a comparable scale.

### When to Apply Scaling
✅ **Required for Algorithms using Euclidean Distance:**
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Gradient Descent-based algorithms (Logistic Regression, Neural Networks)

🚫 **Not Needed for Tree-Based Models:**
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### Standardization vs. Normalization
- **Standardization**: Transforms data to have mean = 0 and std deviation = 1.
- **Normalization**: Scales values between 0 and 1.

## 🎯 Encoding Techniques
Categorical variables must be converted into numerical form before training ML models.

### 1️⃣ One-Hot Encoding
**Converts categories into binary features.**
```python
pd.get_dummies(data['Category'])
```
✅ Best for **Nominal Data** (No order/ranking)  
🚫 Not suitable for high-cardinality features due to **Curse of Dimensionality**

### 2️⃣ Label Encoding
**Assigns numerical values to categories.**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['Category_Encoded'] = encoder.fit_transform(data['Category'])
```
✅ Best for **Ordinal Data** (Order exists)  
🚫 Can mislead models as they assume numerical relationships between categories

### 3️⃣ Target Guided Encoding
**Ranks categories based on target variable mean.**
```python
data.groupby('Category')['Target'].mean()
```
✅ Best for features with **many categories**

### 4️⃣ Mean Encoding
**Replaces category with the mean target value.**
```python
data['Category_Encoded'] = data['Category'].map(data.groupby('Category')['Target'].mean())
```
✅ Works well with **high-cardinality categorical data**
🚫 Risk of overfitting
